# TODO

## CRITICAL:

-   figure out why Keycloak has problems with redirect_uri

## OTHER:

-   make CommentList be in collapsible, with nice unfolding animation etc.
-   dropdown positioning is slightly wrong - the list is ~2px to the right
-   change the loading spinner color to match \$baseColor from rcl-style.scss
