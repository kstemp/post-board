# TODO

-   fix icon margins
-   figure out what happens when you click enter in the comment input field
-   align stuff vertically to center on the community bar
-   use status(400).send({message: 'blabla'}) and then get message from response in frontend

## BACKEND

-   verify token should be top-level
-   rename /post, /community to /posts, /communities etc.
-   logging out should also add token to server blacklist, or something like that

## OTHER:

-   change background color of post to some nice light gray on hover?
-   change the loading spinner color to match \$color-base from rcl-style.scss
